- Add piece square tables

- Consider trying to learn how to implement a hash table for transpositions

- add a GUI
    -probably OpenGL and freeglut, as that is what I am most familiar with.

- Fix problems with enpassant, add pawn promotion/underpromotion, and
test castling for white and black both kingside and queenside. Also make
castling more efficient, while not necessary will make it look slightly
nicer.

- Merge pawn functions in moves.h into only a couple functions, rather
than 7 one-liners. Consider inlining functions. Consider merging black
and white pawn functions.

- Add a feature where you can disable/enable engine analysis with a 
certain input, for example p, instead of just having q, r, and enterring
moves as the input.

- Clean up castling code, the main game loop, and other terrible code
that I threw together in a rush for the deadline.

- Try to find what is causing the engine to have trouble making it past
depth 6 and optimize it/fix it. Aim for depth 8 right now.

- Replace getline in code so that you can compile to non-POSIX systems.

- Consider making the engine run in the background, so the user doesn't
have to wait for it to think.

- Implement a one sided game where the engine only plays for 1 side
instead of suggesting moves for both but not actually playing.

- Clean up my terrible alpha beta search and split it into a min and a 
max function.

- Test repeatedly for playing strength and to find the myriad of bugs 
that keep popping up.

- Add a fen/pgn reader

- Consider adding UCI protocol and multithreading eventually, but only
after other features are complete.
