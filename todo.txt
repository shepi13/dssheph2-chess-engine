- Add piece square tables

- Consider trying to learn how to implement a hash table for transpositions

- add a GUI
    -probably OpenGL and freeglut, as that is what I am most familiar with.

- Fix problems with enpassant, add pawn promotion/underpromotion, and
test castling for white and black both kingside and queenside. Also make
castling more efficient, while not necessary will make it look slightly
nicer.

- Merge pawn functions in moves.h into only a couple functions, rather
than 7 one-liners. Consider inlining functions. Consider merging black
and white pawn functions.

- add a feature where you can disable/enable engine with a certain input,
for example p, instead of just having q, r, and moves as the input.

- clean up castling code, the main game loop, and other terrible code
that I threw together in a rush for the deadline.

- Try to find what is causing the engine to have trouble making it past
depth 6 and optimize it/fix it. Aim for depth 8 right now.
